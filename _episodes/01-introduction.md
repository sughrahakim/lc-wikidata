## 1.1 Intro interface ##
- What is Wikidata?
  - Wikidata's own description says:
  "Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base that can be read and edited by both humans and machines."
  - Let's try this out in the next section of this lesson and see if we as humans can simply read the data on Wikidata:
- Explore a Wikidata Item page:
  - For this purpose go to [Wikidata Main Page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) by typing "www.wikidata.org" into your browser. This is what you should see:

  ![Wikidata_Main_Page](../fig/Wikidata_Main_Page.png)  
  *Screenshot of [Wikidata Main Page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)*

  - Now go to the search bar in the top right corner and enter "british library". This will give you a list with search results. Click the entry that says: "British Library (Q23308) national library of the United Kingdom". Now you should see the british library's item page:
     https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q23308

  - Let us explore the item British Library (Q23308). The top part of the item page serves for identifying the item. It has:
    - unique identifier (Q + a number)
    - label 
    - description
    - aliases
            
  - The bottom part is the "statement" section, that adds statements to the item. A statement has:
    - property (P + a number)
    - value
    - qualifier (optional)
    - references (optional)
    - is a so called triple which will be explained later
    - As you can see a property can have multiple values for one property; for example "member of"; can be further specified by qualifiers (not showen on item British Library).

- All these new definitions like statements, qualifiers and so on can be confusing. If you are not sure you can check this overview graphic https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Datamodel_in_Wikidata.svg:

![Datamodel in Wikidata](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Datamodel_in_Wikidata.svg)

- Usually pages can be edited by anyone; click the pen on the upper-right; Q23308 - British Library is semi-protected; don't worry if you made a mistake, you can always go back in history
    - "View history" - more later
    - "Log in" and other things for registered users

## 1.2 Play games to open ##

- Visit the item page of the city you were born? Does it exist? What kind of information does it show you?

## 1.3 Relationship with other wiki projects ##
- Link from Wikipedia to Wikidata
    - e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species
        - => Follow the link "Wikidata item" on the left side under "tools"
        - => https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20124
        - => the Wikipedia article is linked on the Wikidata's item page. You can find it on the right side.
        - => link to WikiCommons and WikiSource
